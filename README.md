This repository contains the academic article titled *"Operating System for Building Decentralized Networks of Ownership of Physical Assets"*. It presents the conceptual model and protocol architecture of Reeblink — a decentralized operating system enabling scalable, legally-valid ownership of physical assets via DAO LLCs and tokenized governance.

## Abstract
This paper presents a conceptual model of an operating system for building decentralized networks of

ownership of physical assets. The study is based on institutional, legal, and architectural analysis of the

Reeblink model, in which assets such as real estate are included in the network through DAO LLCs,

managed by smart contracts, and connected to digital ownership interfaces (NFTs). It is shown that

such an architecture provides legal legitimation, protocol liquidity, and automated distribution of rights

without the need for centralized intermediaries. The proposed model forms the foundation for

programmable ownership of real assets and scalable management of distributed property.
