This repository contains the academic article titled *"Operating System for Building Decentralized Networks of Ownership of Physical Assets"*. It presents the conceptual model and protocol architecture of Reeblink — a decentralized operating system enabling scalable, legally-valid ownership of physical assets via DAO LLCs and tokenized governance.

## Abstract
This paper presents a conceptual model of an operating system for building decentralized networks of ownership of physical assets. The study is based on institutional, legal, and architectural analysis of the Reeblink model, in which assets such as real estate are included in the network through DAO LLCs, managed by smart contracts, and connected to digital ownership interfaces (NFTs). It is shown that such an architecture provides legal legitimation, protocol liquidity, and automated distribution of rights without the need for centralized intermediaries. The proposed model forms the foundation for programmable ownership of real assets and scalable management of distributed property.

## Extended Description

Reeblink proposes a novel approach to real-world asset integration into blockchain networks. Unlike traditional tokenization projects that merely wrap assets in fractional tokens, Reeblink offers a full-stack protocol architecture — from legal anchoring via DAO LLCs to automated governance through NFTs and smart contracts. This system ensures not only technical decentralization but also legal legitimacy, liquidity, and scalable ownership of physical assets, starting with real estate.

The paper explores:
- the legal model behind DAO Series LLCs,
- how NFTs act as governance keys rather than asset titles,
- the process of network-based rent and buyout,
- and how REBL, the unified network token, supports trustless, algorithmic income distribution.

By positioning real estate as the foundational asset class, the Reeblink protocol sets a precedent for broader applications — including energy infrastructure, land, and utility networks. The result is an operating system for programmable ownership, unlocking decentralized participation in one of the most valuable asset categories in the global economy.
